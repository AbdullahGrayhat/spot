Problem Statement: 
Step by step procedure to perform image processing in a react application which follows the following workflow. 

1. An Image is uploaded to the front end
2. Goes to firebase storage in which a new collection is created for every image that is uploaded and that same collections is used for all of the following processes.
3. Get image URL back. 
4. Sends the URL to the backend server for processing. 
5. Use "sharp" image processing tool to do the following tasks: 
--5a. Create n-number of holes in the image of random radius defined between n and m ranges
--5b. Store different properties of the holes such as the location, radius, co-ordinates etc. in a formatted text file.
--5c. Upload the image to the current collection in the firebase storage.
--5d. Get image URL back and send the URL back to the front end to be displayed to the user.
--5e. Perform image processing using "sharp" that basically makes the color of the holes white and the rest of the image totally blacked out. 
--5f. Upload the image to the current collection in the firebase storage.
--5g. Get image URL back and send the URL back to the front end to be displayed to the user.

I need the code and the commands for everything. 
Commands for setting up a react project, making a client directory, code for the different components being formed and then code for the App.js which calls all those components.
Then making a server directory for the backend server. creating separate files for backend operation, then connecting the frontend and backend to form a complete application.
DO NOT spare any details, start from creating a react application from npx create-react-app in the client directory and explain each step in detail with code. The current directory structure is :
SPOT(project name)
|-client(empty directory)
|-server(empty directory)
